## [Documentation Tecnical](https://danyr59.github.io/technical-documentation-page/ "doc tecnical") 

created with only HTML and CSS technologies, it 
was one of my first freeCodeCamp challenges.

There I created a basic documentation of c++ 
which is one of the languages that I like the most, and it amuses me.
