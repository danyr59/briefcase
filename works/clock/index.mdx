# [Clock App](https://danyr59.github.io/clock/ "clock") 

In this freecodecamp challenge, build a clock-timer.


The test consisted in that the timer, once the session
is over, will start the rest time, as when exercising in
periods (rest and training times) and additional functionalities 
such as being able to stop the time, continue or restart the application.


It was made with React.
