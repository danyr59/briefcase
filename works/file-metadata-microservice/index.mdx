# [File Metadata Microservice](https://file-metadata-d.herokuapp.com/ "file-metadata-microservice") 

File metadata application, where the file details are extracted and the file details are returned as 
a response in a JSON object.


Details like file name, file size, and file type.


In addition to that, the image is saved on the server.


In this challenge I used a library called multer, for the purposes of the challenge, but the topic made me
curious, which I began to investigate, how to achieve the same result without any library, which is a bit 
tedious, but not impossible, since some of the nodejs apis are used to achieve this, as this is simply a binary stream buffer.
