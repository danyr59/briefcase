# [Landing Page](https://danyr59.github.io/product-landing-page/ "landing_page") 

created with only HTML and CSS technologies, it 
was one of my first freeCodeCamp challenges.

here I made a landing page of linux, my favorite operating system

this challenge I learned what responsive design is, and how to layout websites
