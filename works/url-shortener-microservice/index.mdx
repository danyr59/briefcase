# [url-shortener-microservice ](https://danyr59.github.io/url-shortener-microservice/ "url-shortener-microservice") 

first web portfolio, when I started in the world of web development

created with html css and a bit of js, I learned a lot with this project, how to interact with the dom, add events and more
